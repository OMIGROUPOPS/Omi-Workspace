Hi there,

You've been invited to the **OMI Edge** closed beta. We're building a sports pricing intelligence platform that shows you where the books are mispriced — and we'd love your feedback as we shape it.

**What You Can Do**

Once you're in, here's what's available:

- **Game Markets** — Browse upcoming games across NBA, NFL, NHL, NCAAB, and EPL. Each game page shows the OMI Fair Line alongside every major sportsbook so you can see who's mispriced at a glance.

- **Live Edge Tracker** — Real-time edge signals across all active markets. Spot VALUE and MISPRICED opportunities as lines move.

- **Exchange Markets** — See what Kalshi and Polymarket are pricing for the same games. Moneyline, spread, and total contracts from prediction markets, side by side with sportsbook odds.

**A Few Notes**

This is early beta software. Things may break, data may lag, and the UI will keep evolving. That's where you come in — if something feels off, confusing, or if you have ideas for what would make this more useful, we genuinely want to hear it.

Reply to this email anytime with feedback, questions, or feature requests.

Thanks for being part of this,
The OMI Team
